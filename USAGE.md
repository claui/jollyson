# Synopsis

jollyson JKR_FILE
```

# Examples

# Security

Jollyson has no protection against maliciously crafted Joker files.
Jollyson uses Lua code injection to parse the contents of the given
Joker file directly.

Therefore, you should run Jollyson only on files that you trust.
It is safe to run Jollyson on files generated by the copy of Balatro
that you have installed.

If you want to parse Joker files that you downloaded or received from
a third party, use another tool instead of Jollyson.
