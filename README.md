# Jollyson

## What is this?

Jollyson is a CLI tool for Linux that converts Joker files,
[Balatro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balatro_(video_game))’s
serialization format, to JSON.

Examples of Joker files are `settings.jkr`, `meta.jkr`, and
`profile.jkr`.

## Why do I need this?

This tool will give you meaningful diff output if you manage your
Balatro save files and profiles using Git.

It plugs into Git’s
[textconv](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_performing_text_diffs_of_binary_files)
facility.

If you have no idea what this means, then this tool is possibly not
going to be useful to you.

## Installation

### Installing manually

Clone this repository to any directory you like.

Make sure the following packages are installed on your system:

- bash
- jq
- lua
- The `cson` Lua rock (or the lua-cson system package)
- xxd
- zcat (or gunzip)

### Installing from the AUR

Direct your favorite
[AUR helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/AUR_helpers) to the
`jollyson` package.

## Usage

```shell
jollyson JKR_FILE
```

### Examples

```shell
jollyson ~/.local/share/love/balatro/settings.jkr
```

```shell
jollyson ~/.local/share/love/balatro/1/meta.jkr
```

```shell
jollyson ~/.local/share/love/balatro/1/profile.jkr
```

## Security

Jollyson has no protection against maliciously crafted Joker files.
Jollyson uses Lua code injection to parse the contents of the given
Joker file directly.

Therefore, you should run Jollyson only on files that you trust.
It is safe to run Jollyson on files generated by the copy of Balatro
that you have installed.

If you want to parse Joker files that you downloaded or received from
a third party, use another tool instead of Jollyson, e.g. one of the
Balatro Save Editor tools mentioned in the *See also* section.
